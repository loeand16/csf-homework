Problem 3: For Loops<br>
While there are two main types of loops, while-loops and for-loops, for this problem, we will<br>
be working with for-loops. The range() funtion is a common function used to set the number of<br>
iterations the loop will run for.<br>
Using a for loop, give the sum for a(sub n) = a (sub n-1) + 5<br>
where the first term is 1 and n = 100. The answer should be 5346.<br>
<br><br><br>

Problem 4: Writing and Calling Functions<br>
Write a divide(a, b) function that takes two parameters and then call it to divide:<br>
a) 10 / 2<br>
b) 57 / 0<br>
c) 26 / -4<br>
Recall that functions start with "def" and end with a return statement.<br>

<br><br><br>
Problem 5: Lists<br>
Lists have a set order which means the different elements in a given list can be accessed by its index<br>
(eg. listName[0] is the first element of a list). Lists can also be manipulated by various list-related functions<br>
that you can see using dir(list). Set sampleList[] to the value [0,1,2,3,4,5]. Using the list functions,<br>
change the even numbers to the string version of the number (ie. 2 is two) and change the range from 0-5 to 1-8.<br>
<br><br><br>

Problem 6: Scopes<br>
Scopes are different planes of your programming workspace. You will use and change scopes when you use:<br>
import, (nested) loops, functions, if/else statements<br>
Using your divide() function from Problem 4, execute:<br>
x = 0<br>
for i in range(5):<br>
  x = i<br>
  y = 4*x / x**2 #this is where you use your function<br>

In how many scopes was x used? How many times did the program change scope?<br>
answers: 3, 12<br>

<br>
Problem 7: Dictionaries<br>
Using the list you created in Problem 5, make a dictionary that maps "odd" to the odd numbers and<br>
"even" to the even numbers (eg. {1 : 'odd', 'two' : 'even'}.<br>
