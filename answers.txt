Reflection:

this assignment was pretty strait forward and helpful with my lack of understanding loops. My advice to future students is to 'read 
between the lines' and not get caust up with how wordy this problem is. I wish i would have had a better understanding that i was being 
asked to do because I got flustered by all the information on the dna strands when atually that info was not vital to understand.
